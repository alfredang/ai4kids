# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Company

- **Legal name**: Tertiary Infotech Academy Pte Ltd
- **Short name / brand**: **Tertiary Infotech Academy** (not "Tertiary Infotech")
- Use the short name in UI copy, page titles, OG/Twitter metadata, footer, and lead-notification emails. The legal name is for schema.org `Organization`, T&Cs, and invoices only.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # Next.js dev server (Turbopack) on http://localhost:3080
npm run build          # Production build
npm run start          # Run the production build locally on http://localhost:3080
npm run lint           # Next lint (note: ESLint isn't configured at the root; Next's wrapper is what's used)

npm run check:schema   # Verify schema.ts matches ensure-portal-schema.cjs (what creates prod tables)
npm run db:push        # Apply src/db/schema.ts to local Postgres (dev only)
npm run db:migrate     # Run generated migrations (prod-safe)
npm run db:generate    # Generate migrations from schema changes
npm run db:studio      # Drizzle Studio (DB browser)

npm run seed:admin     # Seed initial admin user + default menus + settings (one-time)
npm run migrate:wp     # Import a WordPress SQL dump (parses wp_*, downloads images, writes 301 redirects)
```

There is no test suite — verification is `npm run build` + browser smoke-testing the dev server. The Next build also runs the TS type-check, so it's the canonical "is this broken" gate.

**Port**: this project runs on **3080**, not Next's default 3000 — port 3000 is used by another local app, and 3070 is used by the main Tertiary Infotech Academy site. Both `dev` and `start` pass `-p 3080`; `.env` (`AUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) is pinned to `http://localhost:3080`. If you change the port, update all three in lockstep or Auth.js will silently issue cookies for the wrong host.

**ALWAYS** start the local dev server at `http://localhost:3080/` — never on 3000, 3070, or any other port. Use `npm run dev` (which already binds 3080); never `next dev` directly without `-p 3080`. When opening the app in a browser or sharing URLs, use `http://localhost:3080/` (not `localhost:3000` or `localhost:3070`). Before starting, check that 3080 is free with `lsof -ti:3080`; if a stale process is bound, kill it rather than falling back to another port.

**If the user reports `http://localhost:3080/` is down (or "the local site isn't working", "localhost not loading", etc.), bring it back up immediately — do NOT wait for the user to ask explicitly.** Procedure: (1) `lsof -ti:3080` to see if anything is bound; (2) if nothing is bound, run `npm run dev` in the background; (3) verify with `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3080/` returning `HTTP 200` before reporting success. Treat dev-server restarts as part of the standard workflow, not a separate task.

### Ad-hoc TS scripts

`scripts/*.ts` are run via `tsx`. `tsx` does **not** auto-load `.env`. Either invoke them through the npm scripts (which pass `--env-file=.env`) or source the env first:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a; npx tsx scripts/<name>.ts
```

The `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points at local Postgres. The production DB hostname is a Coolify-internal Docker service name and **is not routable from outside** — direct DB access from a developer machine is impossible. Use the sync API instead (see below).

## Architecture

Self-hosted CMS on Next.js 16 App Router + Drizzle (Postgres) + Auth.js v5. The README has the feature list and folder layout; the points below capture invariants that aren't obvious from one file.

### CMS content is DB-driven with hardcoded fallbacks

Several UI surfaces render from the DB **with a code-level fallback** that takes over on DB failure. When the user asks you to change one of these, you usually have to update the DB **AND** the fallback **AND** any seeder script that recreates it. Otherwise the change is invisible in some environments.

- **Header / footer nav** — [src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx](src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx) reads `menus` + `menu_items` from Postgres; on failure or empty result it falls back to the `FALLBACK` const in the same file. The canonical "rebuild the menu from code" script is [scripts/reset-header-menu.ts](scripts/reset-header-menu.ts) — when you rename a menu item you usually need to touch three places: DB row, `FALLBACK`, and the reset script.
- **Site brand (name, logo)** — [src/lib/site-settings.ts](src/lib/site-settings.ts) reads `settings` rows; defaults are inline.
- **Pages + Posts** — fully DB-only via `pages` / `posts` (no code fallback). Slug is the natural key; status is `draft|published|archived`.

### Credentials & secrets pipeline

`AUTH_SECRET` is load-bearing — it both signs Auth.js sessions **and** derives (via SHA-256) the AES-256-GCM key for the admin credentials vault. Rotating `AUTH_SECRET` makes every encrypted credential undecryptable; if you must rotate it, re-save every credential in `/admin/settings/credentials` afterwards.

Credential lookup pattern, used for Gmail OAuth, Anthropic OAuth, Firecrawl, Tavily — see [src/lib/secrets.ts](src/lib/secrets.ts):

1. `getCredential(key)` first reads `settings` where `key = 'cred:<name>'` and decrypts.
2. Falls back to the matching `process.env.<NAME>` if no DB row.
3. Returns null if neither.

When adding a new secret, **prefer DB-stored** (extend `CredentialKey`, add an `/admin/settings/credentials` field). Only fall back to env if the value is needed before the DB is reachable (e.g. `DATABASE_URL` itself, `AUTH_SECRET`, `SYNC_API_TOKEN`). The `.env` file should stay minimal — boot-time vars only. Operational config (Gmail, lead-notification email, AI tokens) lives in `/admin/settings`.

### Local → Remote DB sync

The production DB isn't directly reachable. To push local CMS data (menus, settings, pages, posts, taxonomy) to production, use the dedicated sync layer:

- **HTTPS API**: `POST /api/admin/sync/{menus,settings,taxonomy,pages,posts}` under [src/app/api/admin/sync/](src/app/api/admin/sync/).
- **Auth**: shared by [src/lib/sync-auth.ts](src/lib/sync-auth.ts) — accepts **either** `Authorization: Bearer <SYNC_API_TOKEN>` (matching env on both sides) or `Authorization: Basic <base64(email:password)>` (validated against the `users` table via bcrypt). Fails closed.
- **CLI**: [scripts/push-to-remote.ts](scripts/push-to-remote.ts) — reads local DB, resolves FKs by natural key (authors by email, categories/tags by slug), POSTs in dependency order (`taxonomy → settings → menus → pages → posts`). The CLI auto-picks bearer if `SYNC_API_TOKEN` is set locally, otherwise Basic with `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- **Slash command**: `/push-to-remote [resource...|all]` — wraps the CLI with a preview + confirmation flow. See [.claude/commands/push-to-remote.md](.claude/commands/push-to-remote.md).

To extend the sync surface to a new table, follow the pattern in [.claude/skills/remote-db-sync/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/remote-db-sync/SKILL.md): natural-key upsert, Zod-bounded payload, register the resource in `scripts/push-to-remote.ts` in the correct FK-dependency order.

### Production schema — `schema.ts` alone does NOT reach production

**Any change to [src/db/schema.ts](src/db/schema.ts) must load the [.claude/skills/portal-schema-sync/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/portal-schema-sync/SKILL.md) skill before committing.**

Production runs **no Drizzle migration step** — the image's CMD is `node ensure-portal-schema.cjs && node server.js` — and `.gitignore` has `*.sql`, so every `drizzle/*.sql` migration is gitignored and never leaves a dev machine (only `drizzle/meta/*.json` snapshots are committed, and snapshots apply nothing). That makes [scripts/ensure-portal-schema.cjs](scripts/ensure-portal-schema.cjs) the **only** thing that creates tables in production.

So a table added to `schema.ts` + `db:push`ed works locally and **500s in prod** with `relation "x" does not exist`. This has already shipped three times (`learner_artworks`, the buddy tables, nearly `learner_stories`). The non-obvious parts:

- New table → add idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` DDL to the boot script **in the same commit**.
- New column on a table the script already creates → `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` **silently skips existing tables**, so you must ALSO add `ALTER TABLE <t> ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS <col> <type>`. This is exactly how `buddy_name`/`buddy_color` went missing in prod.
- Only nullable columns or ones with a `DEFAULT` — `ADD COLUMN ... NOT NULL` fails on tables with rows, and the boot script swallows errors, so it fails silently.
- `npm run check:schema` catches both table and column drift statically (no DB needed). It must pass before committing schema work.
- `db:push` is broken here — use `npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate` for local schema changes. Local Postgres is 18.x, which catalogues `NOT NULL` constraints as `<table>_<col>_not_null`; drizzle-kit 0.30.6 predates PG 18 and tries to `DROP` them, aborting with `column "id" is in a primary key`. Don't force it — those statements strip `NOT NULL`. `db:generate` diffs against the snapshot rather than the live DB, so it's unaffected.

### Authoring blog posts — always load the `blog-post` skill first

Any request to write, publish, edit, or fix a blog post (`/blog/...`) — phrases like "create a blog on X", "write a post about Y", "add a journal entry", "draft a guide", or any change to body content for an existing post — **must** load [.claude/skills/blog-post/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/blog-post/SKILL.md) **before drafting a single line**. The skill covers the non-obvious must-dos that have bitten us repeatedly:

- The public `/blog/[slug]` page renders **`posts.contentHtml`** (not `content`). If you only set the TipTap JSON, the page looks empty. Always pre-render with [src/lib/tiptap-html.ts](src/lib/tiptap-html.ts) and populate both columns.
- Do NOT prefix the opening summary with the literal label "TL;DR —" — write the summary directly.
- Web-search 1–2 fresh sources before drafting topical posts (AI agents, framework launches, regulator news). Hyperlink the canonical product/project URL inline.
- Every external `<a>` needs `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` and a descriptive `title`.
- At least 3 lead-gen CTAs to `/contact?source=blog-<token>` with distinct tokens per position.
- At least 2 deep links to specific tertiarycourses.com.sg course pages (never the homepage).
- Cover image must come from `renderAndUploadCover()` (R2) — never `public/` or local disk.

Also load `seo-audit`, `lead-magnets`, and `blog-cover-image` skills alongside it — the blog-post skill explicitly coordinates with them. After publishing locally, run `npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/push-to-remote.ts posts` to sync the row to production.

### AI features run through the Claude Agent SDK with OAuth subscription auth

Both the public AI chatbot ([src/app/api/chat](src/app/api/chat)) and the admin AI Assist buttons ([src/app/api/ai/assist](src/app/api/ai/assist)) use `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` rather than the metered Anthropic API. The `anthropic_auth_token` (an `sk-ant-oat-...` OAuth subscription token from `claude setup-token`) is read via `getCredential()` and injected into the SDK subprocess env by [src/lib/anthropic-auth.ts](src/lib/anthropic-auth.ts) — it's never exposed to the browser. No per-call API billing.

**HARD POLICY — DO NOT VIOLATE:**
- **Never** call the Anthropic Messages API (`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`) directly from this codebase.
- **Never** add an Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api*`) anywhere — not in env, not in DB credentials, not in code.
- The **only** LLM path in this app is the Claude Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) authenticated with the OAuth **subscription** token (`sk-ant-oat*`) stored under `anthropic_auth_token` in the encrypted credentials store.
- If the chatbot needs to be faster, add deterministic FAQ / pattern matching in [src/lib/chatbot-harness.ts](src/lib/chatbot-harness.ts) — never an HTTP API call.

### Public route layout & SEO

- Single landing page composes section components from [src/components/sections/](src/components/sections/) — `SERVICES` in [src/lib/site-content.ts](src/lib/site-content.ts) is the source of truth for the services grid; items can carry an optional `href` to make the card route to a dedicated page (see the SSG ATO example).
- `[slug]` (dynamic CMS page) and `blog/[slug]` consult `redirects` first before 404'ing — preserves WordPress URLs after migration.
- Each public route exports `metadata` (or `generateMetadata`) plus inline JSON-LD via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. `sitemap.ts` enumerates hardcoded routes + DB-published pages and posts.
- The SEO conventions for this codebase (canonical URL, OG, money keywords, schema choices per page type, British/Singapore spelling) are in [.claude/skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md) — load that skill whenever creating or auditing a public route.

### Lead capture

Every public form (contact form, SSG ATO consultation form, etc.) POSTs to `/api/contact` with `{ name, email, phone?, company?, message, source }`. The `source` field identifies which page/magnet produced the lead — set it per form (e.g. `"home"`, `"ssg-ato-page"`). Submissions land in `leads` and also send a Gmail notification via the OAuth2 credentials stored in the vault. The lead-magnet conventions for this codebase (ICPs, form-field rules, page anatomy) are in [.claude/skills/lead-magnets/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/lead-magnets/SKILL.md).

### Design system

**Two distinct themes live in this repo — do not mix them.** Tailwind 4 with `@theme` design tokens in [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css); fonts are loaded once in [src/app/layout.tsx](src/app/layout.tsx) via `next/font` (do not re-import Google Fonts elsewhere).

- **Bright kids/public theme — the DEFAULT** (everything a child or parent sees: the landing page, `/login`, `/dashboard`, and all `/learn` games, activities, and escape rooms). Cream/white backgrounds, `coral`/`sky`/`mint`/`grape`/`sunny`/`bubble` accents, big rounded cards, soft shadows, emoji icons, gentle hover/float motion. Fonts: `font-fun` (Fredoka, display) + `font-round` (Nunito, body). This is the `html/body` default in globals.css.
- **Dark sci-fi/robotics theme — ADMIN ONLY**, scoped to `.admin-shell` (the `/admin` back-office) and `.prose-dark` (CMS/blog HTML). Near-black backgrounds, `cyan`/`purple` accents, utility classes `glass`, `card-hover`, `btn-primary`, `kicker`, `gradient-text`, `gradient-text-warm`, `glow-blob`. Fonts: Exo 2 (display), Inter (sans), JetBrains Mono (mono). Only use these inside `/admin`.

All UI work in this repo should follow [.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md), which is locked to the bright kids/public theme (with a note on the admin-only dark theme).

### The Android app is a downstream consumer of `/learn` — this repo is the origin

**`ai4kids_android`** (sibling checkout, typically `../ai4kids_android`) is a native port that mirrors the `/learn/*` games' **behaviour** and hand-parses the `/api/learn/*` **contract**. As of **2026-07-17** the flow is **web first, then port to Android**: key changes land here, then get carried over. Nothing in this repo enforces that, so it only holds if you know it.

Two consequences that aren't visible from any single file here:

- **An `/api/learn/*` schema change is a breaking change to a *shipped* client.** Android parses those responses by hand with `org.json` — no compile-time check, no type error. Rename a field in a Zod schema or a `NextResponse.json({...})` and the Android app reads `null` in production. Android has to ship in step.
- **A game's data and its behaviour drift independently.** `src/lib/<game>/*.ts` (word lists, levels, story beats) and `src/app/learn/<game>/*.tsx` (how a round is actually played) are separate layers, and only the first is easy to diff. `src/lib/phonics/content.ts` once sat byte-identical to its Kotlin counterpart while [src/app/learn/phonics/PhonicsQuest.tsx](src/app/learn/phonics/PhonicsQuest.tsx) had gained an entire tap-to-arm mechanic Android lacked. **Matching data files prove nothing about behaviour.**

Before starting new work under `/learn/*` or `/api/learn/*`, read [TODO.md](TODO.md) — it tracks the outstanding parity drift, and the divergences that are deliberate so you don't "fix" them. Android's own porting checklist lives in that repo's `.claude/skills/web-parity/SKILL.md`.

**Real exception:** Code Puzzles is an *Android original* ported to the web. `CodePuzzlesEngine.kt` — not [src/lib/code-puzzles.ts](src/lib/code-puzzles.ts) — is the source of truth for its rules and `LEVELS`; `npm run check:code-puzzles` stands in for the Kotlin test on this side.

## Deployment

Production runs on Coolify with the multi-stage [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (Node 22 Alpine, Next `standalone` output). Pushing to `main` on GitHub triggers an auto-redeploy. Environment variables are managed in Coolify's UI, **not** committed.

Coolify env vars vs `.env`:
- Local `.env` and Coolify env should agree on `AUTH_SECRET` (required for cross-environment credential decryption) and `SYNC_API_TOKEN` (if using bearer auth for the sync API).
- `DATABASE_URL` differs per environment (Coolify provides its own; local points to localhost).
- `REMOTE_SYNC_URL` is local-only (used by the CLI to target prod).
- Everything else (Gmail OAuth, Anthropic token, lead-notification email) should live in `/admin/settings`, not env.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes (adapted from [Andrej Karpathy's CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)). Apply alongside the project-specific instructions above.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
